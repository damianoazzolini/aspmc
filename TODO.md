- add psutil as requirement
- enable (weighted) model counting directly for all solvers, not only sharpsat-td, when possible
- in td_guided_clark_completion make sure that we do not have clauses that are too long
- in the semiring modules make it so that every idempotent semiring supports conversion to a maxsat problem itself
- integrate a better fvs solver
- handle evidence for problog programs
- set probabilistics facts with probabilities 0/1 to false/true.
- use magic set transformation idea to reduce the size of the ground program
- raise errors instead of doing exit(-1)
Maybe:
- handle queries in asp mode
- timeout for compile()?
- handle cnfs that become trivial by unit propagation
