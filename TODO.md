- in the semiring modules make it so that every idempotent semiring supports conversion to a maxsat problem itself
- find out what causes the error in ./main.py -m problog -c test/test_smokers_10.lp -p -k miniC2D
- integrate a better fvs solver
- handle evidence for problog programs
- set probabilistics facts with probabilities 0/1 to false/true.
- use magic set transformation idea to reduce the size of the ground program
- remove temp files even when interrupted
- raise errors instead of doing exit(-1)
Maybe:
- handle queries in asp mode
- timeout for compile()?
- handle cnfs that become trivial by unit propagation
